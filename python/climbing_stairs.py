You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?


class Solution(object):
    def climbStairs(self, n):
        step = [1 for i in range(n + 1)]
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            step[i] = step[i - 1] + step[i-2]
        return step[n]
